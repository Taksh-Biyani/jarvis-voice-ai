# J.A.R.V.I.S. Voice AI

A desktop voice assistant with wake-word listening ("Jarvis" / "Hey Jarvis"),
OpenRouter/Groq-powered conversation, Google search automation, WolframAlpha-
grounded math, a Steam game launcher, and self-updating via GitHub Releases
— built as an Electron app with a HUD-style web UI.

## Setup

    npm install

### API keys

JARVIS works with zero configuration (it falls back to a small local
knowledge base and your OS's built-in speech recognition), but for real
conversational answers you'll want at least one of OpenRouter or Groq —
either is enough on its own, Groq is just faster. There are two ways to
provide keys:

1. **In-app (recommended)** — run the app, click **⚙️ SETTINGS** in the
   header, and paste keys into the API Keys section. Stored in the browser's
   localStorage; nothing leaves your machine except calls to the providers
   themselves.
2. **`.env` file** (baked in at build time):

       cp .env.example .env

   then fill in the values.

| Key | Required? | Get one at |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | One of OpenRouter or Groq — powers conversational answers | https://openrouter.ai/keys |
| `VITE_GROQ_API_KEY` | One of OpenRouter or Groq — much faster responses | https://console.groq.com/keys |
| `VITE_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` | Optional — better speech recognition | https://console.deepgram.com |
| `VITE_WOLFRAM_APP_ID` | Optional — grounds math answers in a real computation instead of the LLM guessing | https://products.wolframalpha.com/api |
| `VITE_STEAM_API_KEY` + `VITE_STEAM_ID` | Optional — launch games from your real library by name | https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey and https://steamid.io |

Steam credentials have their own setup box in the left panel of the app —
same idea, paste and save, no `.env` required.

## Settings

Click **⚙️ SETTINGS** in the header to configure:

- **Open browser tab when searching Google** — Y/N. When off, search
  results still appear in the in-app HUD viewport, just without also
  popping a new browser tab.
- **Voice gender** — Male / Female. Picks a matching system/browser TTS
  voice by name (the Web Speech API doesn't expose a real gender field, so
  this is a best-effort match against common voice names).
- **Voice output meter** — Y/N. Shows a small bar meter near the arc
  reactor that reacts while JARVIS is speaking. It approximates loudness
  from speech cadence (word boundaries), not a literal decibel reading —
  browsers don't expose an audio stream for built-in text-to-speech.
- **API Keys** — OpenRouter, Groq, Deepgram, and WolframAlpha, as described
  above. OpenRouter, Groq, and WolframAlpha key changes apply immediately;
  a newly added Deepgram key requires restarting JARVIS to take effect.
  Without a WolframAlpha key, math questions ("what is 5 plus 3", "square
  root of 144") are answered by whichever LLM is active instead — still
  works, just not guaranteed to be arithmetically correct.
- **Use Groq instead of OpenRouter** — Y/N. Groq's `llama-3.1-8b-instant` is
  much faster than OpenRouter's free model pool. This is only needed to
  *prefer* Groq when you have both keys set — if you only set a Groq key and
  no OpenRouter key, JARVIS already uses Groq automatically regardless of
  this switch. Either way, if Groq fails (rate-limited, network error),
  JARVIS falls back to OpenRouter (if configured), then to the local
  knowledge base — same as always.
- **Software Update** (packaged app only, not `npm run dev`) — shows the
  installed version and checks GitHub Releases for newer ones. Major
  version bumps (`1.x` → `2.0.0`) download automatically in the background
  and just need a click on **Restart & Install** when ready. Minor/patch
  bumps (`1.0.0` → `1.1.0`) show a passive **Download Update** button
  instead — nothing downloads until you click it. Either way, installing
  always requires the explicit restart click; nothing installs itself
  without your say-so.

## Running it

Dev mode needs two terminals — Vite serves the UI, Electron just points a
window at it:

    npm run dev        # terminal 1 — Vite dev server on localhost:3000
    npm run electron   # terminal 2 — opens the JARVIS window/tray

Or skip Electron and just open `http://localhost:3000` in Chrome/Edge —
everything works there too, except the Windows-speech-recognition bridge and
tray icon (the browser's own SpeechRecognition API is used instead).

## Building an installer

    npm run electron:build

Produces a Windows installer in `release/`.

## Releasing an update

`npm run electron:build` only builds locally — it doesn't publish anything,
so existing installs won't see it as an update. To cut a real release that
the in-app updater will pick up:

1. Bump `"version"` in `package.json` (e.g. `1.0.0` → `1.1.0`). This is
   what the updater compares against — skipping it means the release won't
   be recognized as newer.
2. Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` scope (or a
   fine-grained token scoped to this repo with "Contents: Read and write")
   at https://github.com/settings/tokens.
3. Set it as an environment variable and run the release script:

       $env:GH_TOKEN = "ghp_..."     # PowerShell, current session only
       npm run electron:release

   This builds the installer and publishes it as a live (non-draft) GitHub
   Release automatically — the `"releaseType": "release"` setting in
   `package.json`'s `build.publish` block is what makes this happen;
   `electron-builder` creates **draft** releases by default otherwise, and a draft is
   completely invisible to both the in-app updater and anyone visiting the
   repo's Releases page. If a release ever does end up stuck as a draft
   (e.g. from a build run before that setting was added), publish it
   manually from github.com/&lt;owner&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;/releases — no rebuild needed.

## Tests

    npm test

Runs the `node --test` suite in `test/` — headless, no API keys or running
app required.
