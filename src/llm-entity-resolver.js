 * Asks the LLM to pick the real target the user most likely meant, given a

 * strings verbatim, or the literal string "NONE" — anything else (including
 * a plausible-sounding title that isn't actually in the list) is treated as
 * no match. This is what makes the fallback safe to always run: it can never
 * launch something that doesn't exist, only fail to find something that does.
